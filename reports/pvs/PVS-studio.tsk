./src/mpack/rpc.c	248	err	V512 A call of the 'memcpy' function will lead to underflow of the buffer 'dst'.
./src/mpack/rpc.c	248	err	V512 A call of the 'memcpy' function will lead to underflow of the buffer 'src'.
./src/nvim/eval/userfunc.c	1271	err	V595 The 'current_funccal' pointer was utilized before it was verified against nullptr. Check lines: 1271, 1272.
./src/nvim/eval/userfunc.c	2076	err	V595 The 'name' pointer was utilized before it was verified against nullptr. Check lines: 2076, 2104.
